lab1b-client.c:	Client side source code supporting connection to a network on a local machine through
		port. The log option keeps a track of data passed through the socket to the server, if
		the compressed option is chosen then log tracks the data in its compressed state.
		The compress option minimizes bytes sent over to the server through the socket.
lab1b-server.c:	This server side source code provides a connection to client via a network through local
		machine. Their is a compress as well as a shell option included. The shell option
		takes in a shell program and runs it as a child process and sends the output back to
		client through socket. The compress option just makes sure to decompress the data sent
		from the client through socket and compresses again the data sent from the child's shell
		back to client through socket.
Makefile:	I had to make sure the default option makes both c files into their own objects, since
		it appeared to be part of the sanity check. The clean option removes previous object
		files as well as any existing tarballs. The dist option simply packs both C files as
		well as the README and this Makefile
README:		This file describing the contents of the tarball
