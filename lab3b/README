lab3b.py:	This source file parses through a CSV file and detects any inconsistencies
		for the corresponding image file.
Makefile:	Supports the standard default dist and clean. Clean removes the tarball and
		the symbolic link while dist makes the tarball used for submission. The default
		option removes any pre-existing symbolic links for lab3b.py and makes a new
		symbolic link

The TA notes helped me figure out how to start and structure the assignment. Testing the code
incrementally proved extremely helpful as the nature of the assignment was very modular. One of
the hardest parts of this assignment was learning how to use python effectively since we
haven't done any projects this quarter using python. However, it was a boon to finishing this
assignment overall.
