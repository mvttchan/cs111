lab4c_tcp.c- Like project 4B but it receives commands from a server instead
	     using tcp connection
lab4c_tls.c- Same as above but it encrypts the data when sending it through
	     the socket. Uses a different port but the same host as before
Makefile-    Simple makefile with default clean and dist. Default to make
	     both executables, clean to remove all files made by this makefile
	     and the dist to make the tarball for submission

The tcp file was a bit difficult to make. Most of the code was from lab4b but
I made significant changes because some of the functions used before didn't
work so well this time. Fgets for example didn't give the correct outputs.
Also the way I printed the temperature was done in parts, when the server
was expecting them to be done in one print statement. There was also an issue
with the times not being done at the correct intervals. I tried implementing
a different way of displaying time but that didn't work. I looked on piazza and
found that I had to change to nonblocking I/O.
