lab1a.c:
	C program that sets the terminal into a non canonical no echo mode. It supports
	the option --shell and runs the specified program, like "ls". The program forks
	to run the shell and performs inter process communication using pipes.
Makefile:
	Makes a tarball with with the C file, Makefile, and this README. It has a default
	state as well as clean and dist
The first part of getting the program to work non canonically no echo was easy to test
modularity on, however the second part required me to code for a long stretch without
knowing if the code really worked at that point. However, the discussions really helped
provide a framework for the order in which I should code. These sections were essential
for completing my program
