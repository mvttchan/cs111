lab3a.c:
	This code parses through an image and determines the file organization within. It lists
	the super block, group descriptors, free blocks, free inodes, and inode summaries
	that detail the directories and the used indirect referenes, the single, double and
	triple blocks included. This program only parses through one group.
Makefile:
	A simple makefile to build the program. Comes with a clean and dist to form the tarball
	needed for submission

One of the biggest problems was maintaining the offsets used to read. Thankfully the discussion
section and slides provided much needed insight for what numbers we should be expecting. In
addition, the ext2 file page proved incredibly useful for finding the logical offset for
the indirect references.
