lab0.c:
This program reads input character by character from file descriptor 0 and writes to file
descriptor 1. These file descriptors can be adjusted using the --input and --output options.
If there are any I/O errors, the program terminates with exit code 2 for input and 3 for
output. The program can also cause a segmentation fault with the --segfault option and 
the program can also handle that error using the --catch option. Any other options used 
for this program throws an error and exits with code 1.

Makefile:
This is a standard makefile with -Wall, -Wextra, and -g options included, as per the project
spec. Make clean removes unnecessary files and dist makes the tarball needed for submission.
Make check runs smoke tests on the program to test basic functionality.

Smoke tests:

regular_test:
io_comparison: These two just check to make sure if --input and --output options work under
normal circumstances, no monkey business

fake_input: This is a monkey business test. This test just checks to make sure if the program
detects any errors in opening non existant input files

segfault_test: This test just sees if the segmentation fault is found with the correct exit
code of 4

fake_argument: More monkey business. Just checks to make sure if the argument is one of the
four allowed
