lab4b.c:
	Source file for the beaglebone board to allow me to output and log the temperature as well as
	timestamp. It has an adjustable period and lets the user stop and start the process at will
Makefile:
	Contains the desired default, check, clean, and dist options. Default simply builds the program
	while check runs this program through automated smoke tests to ensure functionality. Clean removes
	the files provided by the makefile and dist simply makes the tarball for submission. I had to
	apply the DDUMMY option
smoke_tests.sh:
	Just checks to make sure of the basic functionality of the program. Checks to see if it correctly
	logs output and if the arguments passed in work

I forgot that strcmp compared up to the null byte, fgets reads up to the newline character so the strcmp
function caused unnecessary stress when I couldn't find most strings as my input. I had to change the
last byte from a newline character to the null byte to get it to work. Also, writing to log didn't work
as planned. After researching, I came across fflush which allowed me to write to log flawlessly.
