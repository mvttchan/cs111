lab4b.c:
	Source file for the beaglebone board to allow me to output and log the temperature as well as
	timestamp. It has an adjustable period and lets the user stop and start the process at will
Makefile:
	Contains the desired default, check, clean, and dist options. Default simply builds the program
	while check runs this program through automated smoke tests to ensure functionality. Clean removes
	the files provided by the makefile and dist simply makes the tarball for submission
